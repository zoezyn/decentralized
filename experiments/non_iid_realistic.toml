# Non-IID Realistic Experiment Configuration
# Simulates realistic satellite scenario where each satellite sees highly imbalanced terrain

# Training configuration - FAST for demo
num-server-rounds = 3
fraction-train = 0.5  # Use 50% of clients (5 satellites)
local-epochs = 1
lr = 0.001

# Data partitioning - Non-IID with Dirichlet
partitioning = "dirichlet"
dirichlet-alpha = 0.1  # Very low alpha = highly imbalanced (realistic)
partition-seed = 42

# Limit samples for faster experimentation
max-samples-per-client = 200

# Explanation:
# - Alpha = 0.1 creates highly non-IID data
# - Each satellite will see mostly 1-2 terrain types
# - Satellite over ocean: 90% water, 10% other terrain
# - Satellite over Sahara: 95% desert/brushland, 5% other
# - This reflects real-world satellite deployment patterns
